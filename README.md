# 🚗 Driver Safety Monitoring System

A real-time AI-powered driver monitoring system that detects driver drowsiness (eye closure) and phone usage while driving. Designed to enhance road safety by alerting the driver during unsafe behavior.

---

## 📸 Features

- 🔍 Detects:
  - **Closed eyes** (drowsiness)
  - **Phone usage while driving**
- 📢 Plays alert sound when violations are detected
- 🧠 Uses pre-trained YOLOv8 model
- 🎥 Supports:
  - **Live webcam detection**
  - **Image upload**
  - **Video upload**
- 📝 Stores violation logs for review
